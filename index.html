<h4>What is WienerAI?</h4>
<p>WienerAI is the world’s most
advanced consumer AI trading bot. It
is the first Sausage/Dog/Artificial
Intelligence ever created and the
universe’s most powerful cybernetic
being. This weenie is gunning for “top
dog” on the charts. WienerAI ($WAI)
is currently in the private PRESALE
stage when the price is at its lowest.
When it goes public, the listing price
will be much higher.</p>
<h5>What is the WienerAI Presale?</h5>
<p>The WienerAI Presale allows buyers
to secure WienerAI ($WAI), the
native token of the WienerAI AI
trading bot, at a drastically lower
price than the listing price. There are
several stages, each lasting two days.
At each stage, the price will increase
until the presale is over.</p>
<h6>Is WienerAI A Meme Coin?</h6>
<p>WienerAI is not only A meme coin–it’s
your ticket to better trading, and the
native token of the first AI-powered
trading bot of its kind. WienerAI is
building a legion of fans that he calls
his Sausage Army. There’s a new dog
in the dog park–and it’s WienerAI</p><h3>The Technology Behind
WienerAI</h3>
<p>AI Enhanced Trading:

An AI interface that’s instant, predictive, and beginner-friendly. Simply ask
the bot a question related to your crypto investment needs, and WienerAI
will use its predictive technology to scour the markets in search of a winner. 
Once a winner is found matching your queries, WienerAI delivers unbiased
analysis and reasoning.</p>
<p>Seamless Swaps:

Never miss a golden opportunity again. Once WienerAI has helped you
discover potential large gainers, it allows you to, in just a few clicks, find the
best price from a number of Decentralized exchanges.</p><p>MEV Protection:

Never get frontrun by a MEV bot again. A MEV or Sandwich bot is a type of
trading bot that profits from price differences on decentralized exchanges
(DEXs). When it does so, it frontruns your trade in order to minimize your
gain. WienerAI gets you in front of every frontrunner.</p>
